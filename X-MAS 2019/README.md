Writeups for [X-MAS2019 CTF][1]

Place 336/2460

I have learned many things on this CTF but one most important thing that I learned is to try every category regardless of your experience.
Some stuff I was afraid to start to solve because I am inexperienced at that domain and I was sticking to the things I know.
However, that was a big mistake. If I had more courage, I would definitely got more points and learned much more.
